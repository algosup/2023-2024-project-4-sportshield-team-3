# 2. - Introduction

## 2.1 - Overview

## 2.2 - Project Definition

### 2.2.1 - Purpose

The Goals and Objectives of this project is to work on the development of the SportShield device. The SportShield device is a lockspan powered by a microcontroller and equipped with a set of sensors and a communication module. The device is designed to be attached to a sports equipment, such as a pair of skis, a snowboard, a bike, a surf, etc. The device is intended to provide the user with a set of features to protect the equipment from theft and to monitor the equipment's status.

This Project is piloted by the company [Coris Innovation](https://www.corisinnovation.com/), A company founded in 2015 by St√©phane MAIGE and specialized in the development of innovative products in many fields like Aerospace, Automotive, Energy, Railway, Pharmaceutical, Watchmaking, etc...
