Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that focuses on delivering high-quality software quickly and efficiently. It emphasizes collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement to ensure that the final product meets customer requirements and expectations. XP is based on a set of core values and principles that guide the development process and help teams deliver value to customers. This method is a type of agile methodology that is well-suited for projects with changing requirements and tight deadlines.     

### 2.2 Test Levels

The testing process will be conducted at several levels to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the SportShield device. The test levels include:

1. **Unit Testing**: This level of testing will focus on individual components of the software. The goal is to ensure that each function or method works correctly in isolation. This will be the responsibility of the Software Engineers, who will write and execute these tests.

2. **Integration Testing**: After unit testing, the individual components will be combined and tested together. The aim is to identify any issues that arise when different parts of the software interact with each other. This will be overseen by the Technical Lead and executed by the Software Engineers.

3. **System Testing**: At this level, the entire system will be tested as a whole. This includes testing the software and hardware integration, as well as the complete functionality of the SportShield device. The Quality Assurance team will be responsible for this level of testing.

4. **Acceptance Testing**: The final level of testing is to ensure that the SportShield device meets all the defined requirements and is ready for release. This will involve testing the device in conditions that mimic real-world use to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of the end users. The Project Manager and Quality Assurance team will collaborate on this level of testing.
