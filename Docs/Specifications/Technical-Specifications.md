# 3 - Software Architecture

## 3.1 - Parsing

[*(Back to top)*](#toc)

### 3.1.1 - `parser.c`

This component is responsible for parsing[^19] the structured assembly language code, represented as `function` structs, into a format that can be interpreted and executed. It involves analyzing the instruction, parameters, and other data from each struct and converting them into executable commands or tokens.

**Key Features:**
- `printLines` and `printLine`: Display lines from the file for review or debugging.
- `getFile`: Opens a file and reads its contents line by line, storing each line in an array for further action.
- `getSize`: Calculates the number of lines within the file to allocate memory appropriately.
- `getStructs`: Transforms each line of code into a `function` struct, organizing instructions, parameters, and related data.
- `switchStr`: Distinguishes the segments of each line by type (e.g., instruction, register, or number).
- `setStruct`: Fill a `function` struct with the relevant data extracted from a line of code.
- `printStruct`: Outputs the details of a `function` struct, useful for debugging and verification.

**Usage:**
This component is used to parse the assembly language code into a structured format that can be interpreted and executed. It is called by the main component and is responsible for the parsing process.

**Sequence Diagram:**

The following diagram shows the sequence of operations involved in the parsing process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant main as main.c
    participant getFile as getFile()
    participant getSize as getSize()
    participant getStructs as getStructs()
    participant setStruct as setStruct()
    participant switchStr as switchStr()
    participant printStruct as printStruct()

    User->>main: Execute program
    main->>getFile: Call with file path
    getFile->>getSize: Determine line count
    getSize-->>getFile: Returns line count
    getFile->>getFile: Read lines
    getFile-->>main: Returns lines array
    main->>getStructs: Call with lines array
    loop For each line
        getStructs->>switchStr: Identify string type
        switchStr-->>getStructs: Return type (1, 2, 3)
        getStructs->>setStruct: Populate function struct
    end
    getStructs-->>main: Return array of structs
    main->>printStruct: Display structs for debugging
    printStruct-->>User: Output struct details
```

**Sequence Diagram Explanation:**

- **User starts the program execution**, which kicks off the process in `main.c`.
- **`main.c` calls `getFile()`**, passing the path of the assembly code file to be read.
- **`getFile()` invokes `getSize()`** to determine the number of lines in the file, which is crucial for memory allocation.
- **Back in `getFile()`, the file is read line by line**, based on the line count obtained from `getSize()`.
- **The lines array is returned to `main.c`** after the file has been completely read.
- **`main.c` then calls `getStructs()`,** passing it the array of lines for processing into `function` structs.
- **Within `getStructs()`, a loop processes each line.** For each line, `switchStr()` is called to identify the type of each string segment (instruction, register, or number).
- **`setStruct()` is then called** to populate a `function` struct with the relevant data extracted from the line.
- **Once all lines have been processed into `function` structs, `getStructs()` returns this array of structs to `main.c`.**
- **`main.c` may then call `printStruct()`** to display the contents of each `function` struct, primarily for debugging purposes.
- **The details of the `function` structs are output to the User,** completing the sequence of operations from file reading to data structuring.

**Flowchart Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A([Start]) --> B{getFile}
    B --> C{getSize}
    C --> D[Read File]
    D --> E{for each line}
    E --> F[switchStr]
    F --> G[setStruct]
    E --> H{All lines processed?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Array of Structs]
    H -->|No| E
    I --> J[printStruct]
    J --> K([End])
```

**Flowchart Explanation:**

- **Start:** The beginning of the program execution.
- **getFile:** The function is called with the file path to read the assembly code from the file.
- **getSize:** Determines the total number of lines in the file for memory allocation before reading.
- **Read File:** The actual reading of the file line by line based on the size determined.
- **for each line:** Iterates over each line read from the file for processing.
- **switchStr:** Identifies the type of each segment in the line (instruction, register, or number).
- **setStruct:** Fill a `function` struct with data extracted and identified from the line.
- **All lines processed?:** Checks if all lines from the file have been processed into structs.
    - If **No**, the process loops back to continue with the next line.
    - If **Yes**, it moves forward to the next step.
- **Array of Structs:** Once all lines are processed, an array of `function` structs is formed.
- **printStruct:** Displays the content of each `function` struct, mainly used for debugging.
- **End:** The end of the process.

### 3.1.2 - `parser.h`

This header file defines the structure and prototypes of the functions used in `parser.c`, along with any necessary data structures, constants, and standard or external library headers required for parsing assembly language code.

**Key Components:**

- **Function Declarations**:
    - `void printLines(char **lines, int size)`: Displays lines from the file.
    - `char* getLine(char **lines, int line)`: Retrieves a specific line from the array of lines.
    - `void *getFile(const char *path)`: Reads the assembly code from a file and stores each line in an array.
    - `int getSize(const char *path)`: Determines the number of lines in the file for memory allocation.
    - `void *getStructs(char **lines, int size)`: Processes each line into a `function` struct.
    - `int switchStr(char *str)`: Identifies the type of each string segment.
    - `void setStruct(struct function *f, char *instruction, char *name, char *parameter1, char *parameter2, int line)`: Assigns values to a `function` struct.
    - `void printStruct(struct function *f)`: Displays the contents of a `function` struct.

- **Data Structure Definitions**:
    - `func_t`: A structure representing a line of assembly code, including instruction, name, parameters, and line number.

**Usage:**
This header file is crucial for ensuring that `parser.c` and other components interact seamlessly with the parsing functionality. It defines a clear interface for parsing operations and the necessary structures for holding parsed data.

**Class Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class func_t {
        -char instruction[5]
        -char name[10]
        -char parameter1[10]
        -char parameter2[10]
        -int line
    }

    class parser {
        +void printLines(char **, int)
        +char* getLine(char **, int)
        +void* getFile(const char*)
        +int getSize(const char*)
        +void* getStructs(char **, int)
        +int switchStr(char*)
        +void setStruct(struct function*, char*, char*, char*, char*, int)
        +void printStruct(struct function*)
    }

    func_t : Used to structure the parsed data
    parser : Implements parsing functionality

    parser --> func_t
```

**Class Diagram Explanation:**

- The diagram shows the `func_t` class representing a structured format for a single line of assembly code, including fields for instruction, name, parameters, and line number.
- The `parser` class encapsulates the parsing functionality, with methods for handling file reading (`getFile`, `getSize`), line manipulation (`printLines`, `getLine`), structuring (`getStructs`, `setStruct`), and debugging (`printStruct`).
- The relationship between `func_t` and `parser` illustrates how parsed data is structured and managed within the parsing process.

### 3.1.3 - `tests_parser.c`

This component contains a suite of unit tests designed to verify the functionality implemented in `parser.c`. It focuses on ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the file reading, line processing, structuring, and validation processes integral to parsing assembly language code.

**Test Cases:**

- **File Data Retrieval (`getFileTEST`)**: Validates the ability to correctly read and retrieve data from an assembly code file, ensuring no data loss or corruption occurs during file reading.
- **Line Retrieval Accuracy (`getLineTEST`)**: Tests the precision of retrieving specific lines from the assembly code, verifying the correct line content is accessed, especially focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions.
- **File Size Determination (`getSizeTEST`)**: Confirms the accuracy of calculating the total number of lines in an assembly code file, which is crucial for dynamic memory allocation and data structuring.
- **Struct Processing (`getStructsTEST`)**: Assesses the process of converting raw file lines into structured `func_t` objects, checking for completeness and correctness in the representation of assembly instructions and their components.
- **String Type Identification (`switchStrTEST`)**: Evaluates the functionality that categorizes string segments into instructions, registers, or numerical values, ensuring proper handling and categorization critical for subsequent parsing phases.
- **Struct Value Assignment (`setStructTEST`)**: Examines the correctness of populating `func_t` structures with parsed data, asserting that instructions and parameters are accurately assigned.

**Usage:**
These unit tests are critical for maintaining the integrity of the parsing process. By thoroughly testing each function within `parser.c`, developers can confidently refine and extend the parser's capabilities, knowing its foundational operations are well-verified. This suite not only aids in detecting regressions but also facilitates a test-driven development approach for future enhancements.

### 3.1.4 - `tests_parser.h`

The `tests_parser.h` header file declares unit tests for `parser.c`, specifying test function prototypes that examine the parser's functionality. These tests range from file reading to data structuring, ensuring the parser operates correctly.

**Key Components:**
- `int getFileTEST()`: Checks file reading accuracy.
- `int getLineTEST()`: Ensures specific lines are correctly retrieved.
- `int getSizeTEST()`: Verifies correct file size calculation.
- `int getStructsTEST()`: Confirms lines are properly converted into structured data.
- `int switchStrTEST()`: Assesses correct identification of string types.
- `int setStructTEST()`: Tests correct struct population with data.

**Usage:**
Including `tests_parser.h` in `tests_parser.c` organizes and streamlines testing, allowing for thorough validation of the parser's functionality. It's essential for ensuring parser reliability and supports the easy addition of new tests as the parser evolves.

## 3.2 - Interpreting

### 3.2.1 - `interpreter.c`

    VirtualProcessor --> Interpreter : Uses
```

**Class Diagram Explanation:**

- The `VirtualProcessor` class represents the state of the virtual processor, including its registers, memory, and program counter, crucial for executing assembly instructions.
- The `Interpreter` class encapsulates the functionality required to interpret and execute assembly instructions on the virtual processor. It includes methods for initializing the processor, fetching, decoding, and executing instructions, and performing various operations (arithmetic, logical, data movement, control flow, and system calls).
- The relationship "Uses" indicates that the Interpreter operates on the state managed by the VirtualProcessor, manipulating it according to the semantics of each assembly instruction executed.

### 3.2.3 - `tests_interpreter.c`

## 3.3 - Main

### 3.3.1 - `main.c`

This component acts as the entry point for the virtual processor program, coordinating the parsing of assembly code, initializing the interpreter, and managing the execution of the parsed instructions.

**Key Features:**
- `main(int argc, char* argv[])`: Parses command-line arguments to read assembly file paths and initiates the execution process.
- `loadAssemblyCode(const char* filePath)`: Opens and reads the specified assembly code file, preparing it for parsing.
- `parseCode(char* assemblyCode)`: Utilizes the parser to convert raw assembly code into a format that can be executed by the interpreter.
- `initializeInterpreter()`: Sets up the interpreter, including initializing the virtual processor's state.
- `executeProgram()`: Runs the parsed assembly program, managing instruction execution in sequence.
- `displayFinalState()`: Outputs the final state of the virtual processor, including the values of registers and any relevant memory content.

**Usage:**
`main.c` orchestrates the overall process of executing an assembly language program on the virtual processor. It integrates the parser and interpreter modules, handling file input, execution, and outputting the execution results.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Main as main(argc, argv[])
    participant Load as loadAssemblyCode(filePath)
    participant Parse as parseCode(assemblyCode)
    participant Initialize as initializeInterpreter()
    participant Execute as executeProgram()
    participant Display as displayFinalState()

    User->>+Main: Start with command-line arguments
    Main->>+Load: Provide file path
    Load-->>-Main: Assembly code loaded
    Main->>+Parse: Pass raw assembly code
    Parse-->>-Main: Code parsed into executable format
    Main->>+Initialize: Initialize interpreter
    Initialize-->>-Main: Interpreter and processor initialized
    Main->>+Execute: Execute parsed program
    Execute-->>-Main: Program execution complete
    Main->>+Display: Request final state
    Display-->>-Main: Final state displayed
    Main-->>-User: Program ends
```

**Sequence Diagram Explanation:**

- **Start with command-line arguments**: The user initiates the program execution by running `main.c`, passing any necessary command-line arguments, typically including the path to the assembly code file to be executed.
- **Provide file path**: The `main` function calls `loadAssemblyCode`, providing the file path obtained from the command-line arguments.
- **Assembly code loaded**: The `loadAssemblyCode` function opens the specified file, reads its contents into memory, and returns the raw assembly code to the `main` function.
- **Pass raw assembly code**: The `main` function then passes this raw assembly code to `parseCode` for parsing.
- **Code parsed into executable format**: The `parseCode` function analyzes the raw assembly code, converting it into a structured format that can be interpreted, such as a series of instruction objects or tokens.
- **Initialize interpreter**: With the code parsed, `main` invokes `initializeInterpreter` to set up the interpreter, including initializing the virtual processor's state (registers, memory, etc.).
- **Execute parsed program**: Once initialization is complete, `main` calls `executeProgram` to run the parsed assembly program. This function manages the sequential execution of instructions.
- **Program execution complete**: After executing all instructions, control returns to `main`, indicating the program has finished running.
- **Request final state**: Finally, `main` calls `displayFinalState` to output the final state of the virtual processor, such as the values of registers and any relevant portions of memory.
- **Final state displayed**: The final state of the processor is displayed to the user, marking the end of the program's execution.

### 3.3.2 - `main.h`
