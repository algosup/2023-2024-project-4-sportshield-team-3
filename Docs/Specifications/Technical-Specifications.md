# 1 - Overview

## 1.1 - Purpose

[*(Back to top)*](#toc)

### 1.1.1 - Goals
This project aims to enhance battery efficiency, prolong lifespan, and ensure secure device management. By optimizing energy usage, integrating NFC technology for convenient control, and improving alarm and security measures, the system will offer users a reliable and seamless experience with increased functionality and peace of mind.

### 1.1.2 - Objectives

The project objectives are as follows:

- Improve energy efficiency of the system.
- Management of a low battery situation.
- Increase the battery lifespan.
- NFC is an expected feature for the users, to activate/deactivate the anti-theft system & unlock the cable.
- Via their smartphone and SportShield app (redundant with Bluetooth function, to increase control options for users)
- Add the possibility to stop the alarm when it rings, even if the ringing cycle is not finished.
- Permit the alarm to ring while sending http notification to the server.
- Better management of interruptions
- Increase the security level to connect to the key features of the system

### 1.1.2 - Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:

- Successful implementation and testing of the alarm system. 
- Successful shock detection
- The battery lasts at least 5 days
- 
## 1.2 - Stakeholders

This project is for educational purposes and is intended for commercial use. The project team will be responsible for the development of the project and the client will be responsible for providing feedback and guidance throughout the development process.

## 1.3 - Usage
[*(Back to top)*](#toc)

Provide a reliable security solution for individual users of medium to high-end skis and snowboards.

Develop an innovative anti-theft device for sports equipment and expand its application to other sectors such as camping gear, musical instruments, and locker rooms.

### 1.3.1 - Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjm4NzL6_OEAxVTUaQEHfAYB8MQmhN6BAhVEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffr.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArduino&usg=AOvVaw36wKonvDZOyb7wbdqDRmEy&opi=89978449) - Arduino is an Italian open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) - C/C++ for Visual Studio Code is an extension for VS Code that provides IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing support for C and C++ code.


The software is developed using the Arduino IDE based on C++.


## 1.4 - Scope

[*(Back to top)*](#toc)

### 1.4.1 - In Scope

The project will include the following features:

- Securing sports gear such as skis, snowboards, and related equipment from theft or unauthorized access.
- Sending instant notifications to users via the mobile app in case of unauthorized access.
- Integrating GPS technology to enable users to track the location of their equipment in real-time, enhancing security and facilitating recovery efforts.
- Optimizing power consumption to ensure long-lasting battery life and uninterrupted protection of sports equipment.
- Trigger an alarm sound in case of tampering with the protected equipment.

### 1.4.2 - Out of Scope
