## 1. Overall project status summary

During the 5th week, significant progress was made in establishing team cohesion and defining the project's scope. Despite initial challenges, the team rallied and made considerable strides, particularly towards the end of the week.

## 2. Timeline status

Overall, the project remains on track with the established timeline. However, concerns arise regarding the functionality of certain hardware modules, which may impact future milestones.

## 3. Resources status
The "best" strategy for preserving battery life in a device depends on various factors including the type of device, its intended use, and the specific characteristics of the battery being used. However, there are several universally effective strategies that devices can employ to optimize battery longevity:

1. **Optimized Charging Algorithms**: Utilize charging algorithms that prevent overcharging and minimize stress on the battery. This may involve techniques such as constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging for lithium-ion batteries.

2. **Temperature Management**: Implement temperature monitoring and regulation to keep the battery within its optimal temperature range during both charging and discharging. Avoid exposing the device to extreme temperatures that can degrade battery performance.

3. **Power Efficiency**: Design the device with power efficiency in mind, using energy-efficient components and optimizing software to minimize power consumption. This includes implementing low-power modes during periods of inactivity.

4 . **State of Charge (SoC) Management**: Implement algorithms that accurately estimate the state of charge of the battery based on voltage, current, and temperature measurements. Provide users with clear indications of remaining battery life to avoid unnecessary deep discharges.

5. **Battery Protection Circuits**: Incorporate protection circuits to prevent over-discharge, over-current, and short-circuit conditions that can damage the battery and reduce its lifespan.

6. **Firmware Updates**: Regularly update device firmware to improve battery management algorithms, address battery-related issues, and introduce optimizations for power efficiency.

By combining these strategies, devices can effectively manage battery health and prolong battery life, providing users with reliable performance over an extended period.

## 4. Scope status

The project scope has been outlined in the project charter, serving as a guiding document for the team's activities. Adjustments to the scope may occur based on client feedback and project evolution.

## 5. Work accomplished

3 -We started working on battery managament to keep the battery mostly alive and only use components when needed but the problem that we encountered is there is no ping to mesure the battery level. üîã

## 6. Anticipated risks

- üò¥ Potential for decreased productivity due to team member fatigue.
- üéØ Need for ongoing scope clarification to avoid project drift.
- üõ†Ô∏è Risks associated with unresolved hardware issues impacting project timelines.

## 7. Team feedback

The team is pleased with the progress achieved during the fifth week. While challenges were encountered, there is confidence in the project's feasibility. However, the tight deadlines are generating some apprehension among team members, highlighting the importance of effective time management and resource allocation moving forward.
