## 1. Overall project status summary

During the 6th week, significant progress was made in establishing team cohesion and defining the project's scope. Despite initial challenges, the team rallied and made considerable strides, particularly towards the end of the week.


## 3. Timeline status

Overall, the project remains on track with the established timeline. However, concerns arise regarding the functionality of certain hardware modules, which may impact future milestones.

## 4. Resources status

When two Bluetooth devices wish to communicate, they perform a process called "pairing" where they exchange a unique identifier called a link key. Once paired, they establish a connection by synchronizing their frequency hopping patterns. This allows them to communicate seamlessly without interference from other Bluetooth devices.

If a third device attempts to connect while two devices are already communicating, it waits until one of the existing connections ends or the network bandwidth is available for another connection. This process is managed by the Bluetooth protocol stack, which ensures that each device takes turns transmitting data without causing conflicts or interference.

## 5. Scope status

The project scope has been outlined in the project charter, serving as a guiding document for the team's activities. Adjustments to the scope may occur based on client feedback and project evolution.

## 6. Work accomplished

3 -We started working on Electromagnet and Bluetooth connexion so two devices cant connect both at the same time, 

## 7. Anticipated risks

- üò¥ Potential for decreased productivity due to team member fatigue.
- üéØ Need for ongoing scope clarification to avoid project drift.
- üõ†Ô∏è Risks associated with unresolved hardware issues impacting project timelines.

## 8. Team feedback

The team is pleased with the progress achieved during the sixth week. While challenges were encountered, there is confidence in the project's feasibility. However, the tight deadlines are generating some apprehension among team members, highlighting the importance of effective time management and resource allocation moving forward.
